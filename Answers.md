1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

_React JS is the view layer of the MVC design pattern. It solves the problem of website re-renders by only rendering the small changes made, rather than the whole website for each small change._

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

_Modularly. Much like a composer thinks of different instruments being important on their own but also part of a larger whole (orchestra), or an architect thinks in design by using a repeatable "kit" of "lego blocks" of modular, reusable pieces of a building that come together like a LEGO design._

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

_Class components will have state. They will need to store some data that will be capable of change. You'll need this any time you have data directly there that needs to change, and/or has data that by changing will trickle down through props to change other data throughout your site. _

4.  Describe state.

_Data monitored by React for changes to know when to rerender._

5.  Describe props.

_When someone commends you for a job well done._
